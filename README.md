# my-financial-fortress-backend
Backend of an application used to secure the financial future. It is based on knowledge from Marcin IwuÄ‡'s book "Financial Fortress", where the author presented a model portfolio to ensure a secure future for long-term investments such as retirement. The application suggests how to distribute capital among various financial instruments, along with their valuation history. 

When the app receives the value of the capital to be invested, it takes the current values of the 6 financial instruments presented in the book and divides the entire capital based on the suggested proportions taking into account such variables as the exchange rate, the conversion of a troy ounce to a trading ounce and the commission.
The application automatically downloads current valuations twice a day to clearly show the change in the entire portfolio, as well as individual parts of it.

In the future, I would like to expand it with the possibility of comparing different portfolios and the direct possibility of buying financial instruments.

Due to the fact that the full functionality, any charts, changes are visible only after some time, I provide my data from the database :https://github.com/weronikamartamalicka/my-financial-fortress-backend/tree/main/Application%20database%20data

HIT THE FinancialFortressBackendApplication BUTTON and enjoy!
