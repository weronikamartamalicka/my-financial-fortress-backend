# my-financial-fortress-backend
Backend of an application used to secure the financial future. It is based on knowledge from Marcin Iwucia's book "Financial Fortress", where the author presented a model portfolio to ensure a secure future for long-term investments such as retirement. The application suggests how to distribute capital among various financial instruments, along with their valuation history. In the future, I would like to expand it with the possibility of comparing different portfolios and the direct possibility of buying financial instruments.
